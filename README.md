# Smart Garden

### Description:
This project is a web-based platform about plants and their cultivation. It should provide a range of services like a blog, a chat, a gallery and others. But the main goal is an application to control the breeding of plants. Therefore devices are needed, which are sold in the shop. After creating an account the user register a main device to get access to its dashboard through internet. When the serialnumber is correct, he can add modules like sensor for soil moisture to it, which are connected to the hub by RF. The actual measured value and before that in a period of 30 minutes will be shown on the display. The data of the devices get stored in the cloud. Now the user is able to observe or control the grow of his plants by using lights, waterpumps, heatings, etc. The collected data of the users can help to determine an optimized template of each kind of plant as an offer for an automized planting.

### Details:
For the frontend application we have used react. The functionality of the surface relies on reactstrap and bootstrap, but the design was completely changed. A color theme based on the world of plants divides the platform into different parts compared to their lifecycle. The optical appearance of the interface is less technical, more like a printed guidance and fact sheet written in scss. On backend side we have installed node.js and using a mysql database. For informations in realtime the devices are communicating with the application over websocket by socket.io.
